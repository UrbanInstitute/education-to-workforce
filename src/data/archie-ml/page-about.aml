[+about_a]
<p><em>Published May 13, 2025</em></p>

<p>This tool draws from publicly available national data sources to provide a comprehensive view of the education-to-workforce landscape in the United States. The tool pulls all education data directly from the <a href="https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer" target="_blank">Urban Institute’s Education Data Portal</a>, which includes geocoded information about schools, districts, and colleges in the US, allowing for geographic aggregation. For other data sources, the tool uses saved copies of datasets (latest update March 31, 2025). We hope to continue updating this tool with the most recent data moving forward.</p>

<p>Data sources in the tool include the following:</p>

[+about_b]

<p>Metric definitions come from the Education-to-Workforce Indicator Framework and are noted where metrics are displayed throughout the tool. Metrics measured at the school level are aggregated to the geographic level selected, meaning neighboring census tracts within the same county or school district might have different values (including missing values) for a metric. Data that are unavailable, or unavailable at scale, are noted with the individual metric cards. All geographies are from the 2020 Census definitions.</p>

<p>Information in source data might be suppressed or unavailable for small populations to protect privacy. In these cases, data are reported in the tool as missing. Time lags between the data collection from different sources might create temporal misalignment across sources. For more information on specific methodologies or for access to raw data files, refer to the individual source documentation linked above.</p>

<p>We use the abbreviation AAPI for Asian American Pacific Islander and NHPI for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. We use the term Hispanic to refer to people of Hispanic or Latino origin to align with how the data were collected. We recognize that this term may not be the preferred identifier for many, and we remain committed to using inclusive language whenever possible.</p>
